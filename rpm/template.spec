%description
The State Machine Compiler (SMC) from http://smc.sourceforge.net/ converts a
language-independent description of a state machine into the source code to
support that state machine. This package contains the libraries that a compiled
state machine depends on, but it does not contain the compiler itself.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
